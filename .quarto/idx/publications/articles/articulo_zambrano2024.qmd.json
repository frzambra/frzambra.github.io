We derived the SPI for water demand. We also derived the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) for water supply. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) shows the combined effect of AED and precipitation. We estimate the standardized anomaly of cumulative soil moisture at one meter (zcSM) and the standardized anomaly of cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI) to show the impact of water demand and supply.

Also we calculated the temporal correlation between the indices of water supply and demand, and soil moisture with the zcNDVI (proxy of vegetation productivity).
