It discusses the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the standardized anomaly of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (zNDVI), and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) used in Chile for agricultural drought. The chapter also describes some of the most relevant long-term data sets from Earth observation for agricultural drought, such as MODIS, AVHRR, and CHIRPS. The standardized anomaly of cumulative NDVI within the growing season index (zcNDVI) as a well-fit index for agriculture is presented. Finally, the zcNDVI and SPI at the end of the season for the vegetation in Central Chile are analyzed beginning with the year 1981.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Citation (APA 7)\n\n>  Zambrano, F.
