A strong Spearman‚Äôs (ùúå\n) correlation between turgor pressure and vegetation indices was obtained, having ‚àí0.88 with EVI and ‚àí0.81 with GVMI for season 2018‚Äì2019, and lower correlation for season 2019‚Äì2020, reaching ‚àí0.65 with Rededge1 and ‚àí0.66 with EVI. However, the NIR range‚Äôs indices were influenced by the vegetative development of the crop rather than its water status. The red-edge showed better performance as the vegetative growth did not affect it. It is necessary to expand the study to consider higher variability in kiwifruit‚Äôs water conditions and incorporate the sensitivity of different wavelengths.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Citation (APA 7)\n\n>   Jopia, A., Zambrano, F., P√©rez-Mart√≠nez, W., Vidal-P√°ez, P., Molina, J., & de la Hoz Mardones, F.
