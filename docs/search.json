    "text": "Fund Name: CREA Ciencia 2030\nFund Agency: National Research and Development Agency (ANID)\nYear: 2021\nFund total amount: 5 millions chilean pesos ($CLP)\n\n\nClimate change is having two primary impacts in Chile. First, through the sustained reduction in precipitation, and second, through rising temperatures. Rising temperatures have an impact, first, by increasing vegetation demand for water and second, by shifting vegetation phenological development stages. This has led to a significant reduction in water resources, affecting both ecosystems and agricultural production, especially in the Aconcagua River basin in Chile, where droughts have intensified. This threatens biodiversity and agricultural security, particularly in crops such as avocado, which require up to 18,000 m³/ha annually in certain areas.\nTo address this problem, a comprehensive system is proposed that combines groundwater zoning with a phenological analysis of avocado orchards and native forests. The goal is to identify the areas most susceptible to water stress and improve water management, increasing the resilience of ecosystems and crops to climate change. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems for mapping groundwater zones; however, gaps persist in our understanding of how vegetation interacts with groundwater, an aspect this project seeks to address. Additionally, various studies have shown that climate change negatively impacts the phenological stages of avocado trees, which points to the importance of efficient water management. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between potential groundwater zones and the phenology of avocado trees and native sclerophyllous forests in the Aconcagua Basin, using zonation techniques and phenological analysis using remote sensing and artificial intelligence. To this end, a zonation model will be developed using spatial statistics techniques and a predictive artificial intelligence model that will evaluate geomorphometric, hydrological, and spectral variables to categorize productive and unproductive wells and generate a groundwater probability map. The results will enable more effective water management in both agriculture and ecosystem conservation, providing critical information for water use planning in regions affected by scarcity. Furthermore, the results of this work will enable future applications for applied research projects (e.g., FONDEF) aimed at implementing solutions to contribute to water sustainability and the adaptation of agricultural systems and natural ecosystems to climate change."

    "text": "Abstract\nSince 2010, central Chile is experiencing a multi-dimensional crisis due to the pervasive impacts of the ongoing mega drought. Political institutions and stakeholders have responded reactively to socio-economic crises associated with the mega drought as they emerge (particularly in the agricultural and health sectors),. While governments should move towards risk-based management (Wilhite et al. 2014), they require robust decision-making tools to facilitate the transition. One such tool are early warning systems (EWS), which aim to reduce vulnerability and to improve response capacity of people at risk. However, the current observatory developed for Chile, the Chilean Agroclimatic Observatory (Verbist et al., 2016), was mainly designed for scientific research and has a poor user experience (UX).\nTo this end, we propose the development of a multi-scale drought observatory for Chile that will help mitigate agricultural and ecological impacts. Using a macrosystems perspective (Heffernan et al. 2014), this observatory will integrate global climate and land satellite data with in-situ measurements from national weather stations. It will have two main components: i) monitoring climate and land variables and their impacts on agricultural and socio-ecological systems, and ii) a drought early warning system (DEWS). The drought monitoring and DEWS platforms will target three user groups – the general public, decision makers , and the scientific community - and will comply with FAIR data principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016), to enhance usability of all products. We will monitor drought-related variables at two spatial scales: the national scale (Fig. 1a) and at ii) the local scale, for which we selected the Aconcagua watershed (Fig 1b). Local-scale measurements will also be used to validate and improve drought monitoring at the national scale. We selected this watershed for two reasons: i)it has been highly impacted by drought, which have triggered several conflicts this year (2021)between agricultural interests and groups concerned with access to drinking water; and ii) this watershed will provide a preview of the future for other watersheds that have yet to experience the evolving, multi-dimensional impacts of similarly extreme droughts."

    "text": "Abstract\nWater scarcity due to climate change has severely impacted agriculture in central Chile, making efficient irrigation management a critical need. This project aims to develop SatOri, a low-cost, satellite-based decision-support service to optimize irrigation in kiwi and cherry orchards. The innovation integrates two key components: (1) determination of optimal deficit irrigation strategies (RDC) that reduce water use without compromising yield or fruit quality, and (2) estimation of canopy water status—specifically leaf turgor potential—through machine learning models based on multispectral and radar satellite data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat 8).\nThe research involves field trials with varying irrigation treatments and continuous monitoring of plant water status using Scholander chambers, ZIM turgor sensors, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Satellite indices in the VNIR, SWIR, and microwave ranges are evaluated as predictors of plant hydration. The optimal irrigation regime will be validated in the second season, and a prototype web platform will be built to provide near-real-time irrigation recommendations using open satellite imagery and cloud-based infrastructure.\nBy focusing on plant response rather than indirect climatic indicators, SatOri promises a scalable, farmer-friendly tool for adaptive irrigation under increasing water limitations—contributing to sustainable agriculture and climate resilience in Chile and beyond."

    "text": "Abstract\nGlobal food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate its negative consequences. Chile is facing what some authors have been calling a mega-drought. Recent studies showed a tendency toward a drier condition (1960-2016) in the central-southern part (30-48°) and indicated that the future projections condition could be potentially underestimated for this region. Recent analyses reveal that 52% of the area under wheat in Chile would face a serious decline in rainfall in 2030-2050. Hence, the country is under urgent need of taking action regarding adaptation measures. The early warning system is the first step for adaptation -if it is possible to anticipate the impact, then it will be feasible to do something to diminish the losses- for which are of increasing need. The understanding of how environmental variables (i.e., precipitation, soil moisture, temperature) impact vegetation productivity under the current climate change will allow improving early warning models.\nThe standard practice for food security assessments at a regional scale is by the monitoring of drought that affects agriculture using vegetation indices (Vis). Such systems offer food security alerts at a medium spatial resolution that are not detailed enough to detect the emergence of local food insecurity conditions and often leverage remote sensing only in a qualitative sense. To account for the impact in yield quantitatively, there is a lack of crop production data (yield, surface, production) worldwide that need to will. Recent improvements in the spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of Earth Observations satellites (EO) hold significant potential for improved food security assessments. This project aims to develop a near-real-time seasonal prediction model for agricultural drought impact on maize and wheat in central Chile. Were defined three objectives considering wheat and maize: I) select a proxy for biomass from multiple satellite data with similar spectral but different spatial resolution (10m and 250m); 2) develop a biomass estimation model from the proxy derived from public satellite data; and 3) develop a seasonal prediction model for yield from multiple satellite estimates of vegetation, precipitation, soil moisture, and land surface temperature. Throughout the project will be analyzed high spatial resolution satellite data from sensor Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI by using the new “sen2-Agri” system which allows for ingesting it and retrieving the phenology (start, end, and length of the growing season) and spectral vegetation indices. Also, coarse spatial resolution data from sensor MODIS product MOD13Q1 collection 6 was considered for which will be developed a model to extract phenology and compare it with the one derived from the high-resolution data. For both will be calculated proxies for biomass at different times through the season which will be validated with infield measures of wheat and maize, allowing to develop a biomass model (BM). This BM will be used to obtain yield data by calculating biomass at the end of the season (EOS) and so be able to reconstruct historical records (2000-2022).\nThe last stage of the project consists in the developing of a prediction model for wheat and maize yield, from satellite environmental data of soil moisture, precipitation, land surface temperature and the proxy of yield itself following a similar approach as in Zambrano et al. (2018). Two models will be tested regardless the availability of soil moisture data, one considering the period 2015-2022 in which all the described variables will be used (M1), and the second by discard soil moisture and defined through for 2000-2022 (M2). The prediction lead-time used will be one to six month before the EOS. It expected that the results of this project could help to anticipate losses on wheat and maize, and so contribute to adaptation measures, and to improves early warning system at a local scale. As the data used here are publicly available globally, the models obtained could be adopted around the globe."

This phenomenon can not only affect the agriculture but can also impact the sustainability of ecosystems. Therefore, the objective of this research is to preliminarily analyze the response of agricultural and natural vegetation areas to the megadrought in the Aconcagua basin. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was obtained in Google Earth Engine and a drought index was calculated. Finally, statistical analyzes were carried out. The drought effect was evidenced in the study basin (r ≥ 0.5), mainly in natural vegetation areas, and a tendency of NDVI to decrease was reflected. Therefore, a sustainable management of water resources and ecosystems in the Aconcagua River is essential in the face of drought processes."

This problem can’t only affect agriculture, people, and access to drinking water in Chilean basins, but it can also affect the ecological integrity of ecosystems, particularly those known as groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDE). The main objective of this research is to examine the relationship between groundwater-dependent ecosystems and drought using satellite data in the Aconcagua basin in central Chile.\nStandardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were calculated to analyses relationship between groundwater-dependent ecosystem and drought. In addition, these parameters were analysed throughout the basin. To obtain and process these indicators between the years 2002 and 2022, the Google Earth Engine platform and the R environment were used. Subsequently, statistical analysis of the time series was performed, including Pearson correlation, Mann Kendall test, and Sen slope estimator. The results show that the SPI-SPEI at 12-24 months had a moderate correlation with the NDVI in much of the basin (&gt;4) and high in the GDEs (&gt;0.5). The slope of the Sen was more pronounced in the GDE zones, and the trend was decreasing with respect to the NDVI. LST and SPEI increased in the GDEs. In conclusion, the GDE zones were affected by drought processes, which demonstrates the need for sustainable management of these important ecosystems."

    "text": "Abstract\nA persistent drought is impacting Chile. It affects the hydrological system and vegetation development. Research studies have focused on the central part of the country. This is due to a persistent period of water scarcity. This scarcity has been found to be a megadrought. This megadrought was defined by the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) of twelve months in December. The SPI only considers precipitation as a drought indicator. It does not account for atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), soil moisture, or their combined vegetation productivity. We present a developing database (DDS4Chl) of drought indices for continental Chile since 1981. The indices measure water demand, supply and its impact on vegetation. We derived the SPI for water demand. We also derived the Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) for water supply. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) shows the combined effect of AED and precipitation. We estimate the standardized anomaly of cumulative soil moisture at one meter (zcSM) and the standardized anomaly of cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI) to show the impact of water demand and supply. We present the historical linear trend of the drought indices in continental Chile. Also we calculated the temporal correlation between the indices of water supply and demand, and soil moisture with the zcNDVI (proxy of vegetation productivity). The dought index for soil moisture acummulated at 12 months (zcSM-12) showed to be the best predictor of vegetation productivity around continental Chile."

    "text": "Abstract\nGlobal food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000–2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a 17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times. The mean Rcv2 values for OLR were 0.95, 0.83, 0.68, 0.56, 0.46 and 0.37, against 0.96, 0.84, 0.65, 0.54, 0.46 and 0.38 for DL, for one, two, three, four, five, and six months lead time, respectively. Given the wide range of climates and vegetation types covered within the study area, we expect that the presented models can contribute to an improved early warning system for agricultural drought in different geographical settings around the globe."

    "text": "Abstract\nLand use and land cover (LULC) change is a dynamic process influenced by various factors, including agricultural expansion. In Chile’s Aconcagua Basin, avocado plantations are potentially driving territorial transformations. However, current land cover data lacks the resolution required to accurately assess this impact. Accordingly, our study used advanced geospatial analysis techniques to address this gap. Through a detailed analysis of the spatial and temporal changes, it was determined that the most significant expansion of avocado plantations occurred between 2003 and 2013, with an increase of 402%. This growth primarily took place at the expense of native vegetation, particularly sclerophyllous shrubland, as well as other agricultural lands, near agricultural and urban lands. By 2023, changes in avocado plantation were significantly slower, with minimal alterations in LULC (5%), suggesting a possible influence of drought on small-scale farmers. However, the small loss of avocado plantation was mainly replaced by fruit farm land. Moreover, our findings suggest that while avocado plantations have become larger, more dominant, and more isolated, native vegetation has become more fragmented and reduced in patch size. Based on these results, sustainable land management practices were proposed. These findings provide a crucial foundation for developing sustainable land management strategies that balance agricultural production with environmental sustainability, landscape transformation and the well-being of local communities."

    "text": "Abstract\nQuantifying drought’s economic impacts has been key for decision-making to build future strategies and improve the development and implementation of proactive plans. However, climate change is changing drought frequency, intensity, and durability. These changes imply modifications of their economic impact, as longer droughts result in greater cumulative economic losses for water users. Though the longer the drought lasts, other factors also play a crucial role in its economic outcomes, such as Infrastructure capacity (IC), the Amount of Water in Storage (AWS) in reservoirs and aquifers, and short- and long-term responses to it. This study proposes and applies an analytical framework for the economic assessment of long-run droughts, assessing and explaining central Chile megadrought economic effects through the factors that begin to influence the economic impact level in this setting. High levels of both IC and the AWS, as well as short- and long-term responses of water users, allow for high resilience to long-run droughts, tolerating extraordinary water disruption in its society with relatively low total economic impacts. Despite this adaptability, long-term droughts bring places to a water-critical threshold where long-term adaptation strategies may be less flexible than short-term strategies, escalating the adverse economic effects. This fact suggests that the economic evaluation of megadrought needs to focus on future tipping points (substantial water scarcity). The tipping point depends on the IC, how water users manage the AWS, and adaptation strategies. Establishing the tipping point should be a priority for future interdisciplinary research."

A group of mainly women along with the children of three local rural elementary schools were involved in the principal aspects of the research, from design to implementation and remediation options. The study area receives considerable, but highly variable, rainfall, and the hydrogeological setting does not offer enough interannual natural storage to cope with increasing demand and variable water viability. Our results also showed that chemical quality of the water is relatively good, except for the high concentration of iron (Fe; &gt;0.3 mg L−1), manganese (Mn; &gt;0.1 mg L−1), and turbidity (&gt;5 nephlometric turbidity units [NTU]). From the microbiological point of view, the water is of poor quality. The low water quality could be related to the lack of maintenance of water collection systems, nonmaintenance of septic tanks, animal traffic, and low coverage of associated riparian vegetation. In the present approach the involvement of children in research helped to stimulate the improved management of both land and water resources by the community, and this practice could be applied in small rural watersheds in developed or developing countries."

    "text": "Abstract\nDrought is one of the most complex natural hazards because of its slow onset and long-term impact; it has the potential to negatively affect many people. There are several advantages to using remote sensing to monitor drought, especially in developing countries with limited historical meteorological records and a low weather station density. In the present study, we assessed agricultural drought in the croplands of the BioBío Region in Chile. The vegetation condition index (VCI) allows identifying the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation conditions associated with stress because of rainfall deficit. The VCI was derived at a 250 m spatial resolution for the 2000–2015 period with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 product. We evaluated VCI for cropland areas using the land cover MCD12Q1 version 5.1 product and compared it to the in situ Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for six-time scales (1–6 months) from 26 weather stations. Results showed that the 3-month SPI (SPI-3), calculated for the modified growing season (November–April) instead of the regular growing season (September–April), has the best Pearson correlation with VCI values with an overall correlation of 0.63 and between 0.40 and 0.78 for the administrative units. These results show a very short-term vegetation response to rainfall deficit in September, which is reflected in the vegetation in November, and also explains to a large degree the variation in vegetation stress. It is shown that for the last 16 years in the BioBío Region we could identify the 2007/2008, 2008/2009, and 2014/2015 seasons as the three most important drought events; this is reflected in both the overall regional and administrative unit analyses. These results concur with drought emergencies declared by the regional government. Future studies are needed to associate the remote sensing values observed at high resolution (250 m) with the measured crop yield to identify more detailed individual crop responses."

However, we could manage the irrigation by monitoring the plant’s water status by measuring the stem water potential (Ψ_s), which is currently costly and time ‐consuming. The primary goal of this work is to predict the daily spatial variation of Ψ_s using machine learning models. We measured Ψ_s in two orchards planted with sweet cherry tree variety Regina, and we monitored 30 trees weekly and biweekly in the central part of Chile, during two seasons, 2022‐2023 and 2023‐2024, and between October and April. To predict the Ψ_s, we used the random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM) models. We selected vapor pressure deficit (VPD), reference evapotranspiration (ET0), relative humidity, and temperature as weather predictors. Also, we used as predictors spectral vegetation indices (VIs) and biophysical parameters derived from Sentinel‐2. We compared two schemes, one for estimation and another for prediction. We discovered that XGboost and RF worked best for both. The estimation had an R^2 of 0.76 and an RMSE of 0.24 MPa. The prediction, on the other hand, had an R2 of 0.59 and an RMSE of 0.36 MPa. The analysis of importance variables reveals that weather predictors, such as VPD, ET_o, and temperature, have a higher weight in the model. These are followed by VIs that use short‐wave infrared regions, which highlight the moisture stress index (MSI) and the disease and water stress index (DWSI)."

This is challenging in many parts of the world, which often have a limited number of weather stations and/or historical data records. Satellite-derived precipitation products offer a viable alternative with several remotely sensed precipitation datasets now available with long historical data records (+30years), which include the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) datasets. This study presents a comparative analysis of three historical satellite-based precipitation datasets that include Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B43 version 7 (1998–2015), PERSIANN-CDR (1983–2015) and CHIRPS 2.0 (1981–2015) over Chile to assess their performance across the country and for the case of the two long-term products the applicability for agricultural drought were evaluated when used in the calculation of commonly used drought indicator as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). In this analysis, 278 weather stations of in situ rainfall measurements across Chile were initially compared to the satellite data. The study area (Chile) was divided into five latitudinal zones: North, North-Central, Central, South-Central and South to determine if there were a regional difference among these satellite products, and nine statistics were used to evaluate their performance to estimate the amount and spatial distribution of historical rainfall across Chile. Hierarchical cluster analysis, k-means and singular value decomposition were used to analyze these datasets to better understand their similarities and differences in characterizing rainfall patterns across Chile. Monthly analysis showed that all satellite products highly overestimated rainfall in the arid North zone. However, there were no major difference between all three products from North to South-Central zones. Though, in the South zone, PERSIANN-CDR shows the lowest fit with high underestimation, while CHIRPS 2.0 and TMPA 3B43 v7 had better agreement with in situ measurements. The accuracy of satellite products were highly dependent on the amount of monthly rainfall with the best results found during winter seasons and in zones (Central to South) with higher amounts of precipitation. PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS 2.0 were used to derive SPI at time-scale of 1, 3 and 6 months, both satellite products presented similar results when it was compared in situ against satellite SPI’s. Because of its higher spatial resolution that allows better characterizing of spatial variation in precipitation pattern, the CHIRPS 2.0 was used to mapping the SPI-3 over Chile. The results of this study show that in order to use the CHIRPS 2.0 and PERSIANN-CDR datasets in Chile to monitor spatial patterns in the rainfall and drought intensity conditions, these products should be calibrated to adjust for the overestimation/underestimation of rainfall geographically specially in the North zone and seasonally during the summer and spring months in the other zones."

For this, remote sensors have an important role since they allow obtaining the daily ET of the crops. This research presents the estimate of ET, calculated using data from the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites, ERA-5 reanalysis data, land cover, and the Digital Elevation Model. For this, we used the algorithm Sen-ET. The ET was estimated in the five main orchards regarding the surface planted in the Aconcagua’s river basin (avocado, walnut, mandarin, grape vine, and peach). The period of time analyzed was from September 2022 to May 2023. We evaluate the spatio-temporal variation and calculate the total ET for the season per crop. Avocados reach the highest ET with 114.6 mm/season. The rest of the crops had between 95.4% and 83.3% of the demand for avocado. This study is the first approach to using sen-ET to evaluate the water requirements of crops in Chile. We need to advance further to improve the input data used (e.g., landcover) and validate the results."

    "text": "Abstract\nFor more than ten years, Central Chile has faced drought conditions, which impact crop production and quality, increasing food security risk. Under this scenario, implementing management practices that allow increasing water use efficiency is urgent. The study was carried out on kiwifruit trees, located in the O’Higgins region, Chile for season 2018–2019 and 2019–2020. We evaluate the time-series of nine vegetation indices in the VNIR and SWIR regions derived from Sentinel-2 (A/B) satellites to establish how much variability in the canopy water status there was. Over the study’s site, eleven sensors were installed in five trees, which continuously measured the leaf’s turgor pressure (Yara Water-Sensor). A strong Spearman’s (𝜌 ) correlation between turgor pressure and vegetation indices was obtained, having −0.88 with EVI and −0.81 with GVMI for season 2018–2019, and lower correlation for season 2019–2020, reaching −0.65 with Rededge1 and −0.66 with EVI. However, the NIR range’s indices were influenced by the vegetative development of the crop rather than its water status. The red-edge showed better performance as the vegetative growth did not affect it. It is necessary to expand the study to consider higher variability in kiwifruit’s water conditions and incorporate the sensitivity of different wavelengths."
