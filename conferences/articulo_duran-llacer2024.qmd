## Abstract

Since 2010, central Chile has been experiencing a megadrought that has affected the hydrological cycle, agriculture, and people. This phenomenon can not only affect the agriculture but can also impact the sustainability of ecosystems. Therefore, the objective of this research is to preliminarily analyze the response of agricultural and natural vegetation areas to the megadrought in the Aconcagua basin. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was obtained in Google Earth Engine and a drought index was calculated. Finally, statistical analyzes were carried out. The drought effect was evidenced in the study basin (r ≥ 0.5), mainly in natural vegetation areas, and a tendency of NDVI to decrease was reflected. Therefore, a sustainable management of water resources and ecosystems in the Aconcagua River is essential in the face of drought processes.
